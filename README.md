## üìå Notes

- Distance and percentile values are calculated using tract centroids and CBSA center points defined as the city hall of the central city in the CBSA.
- `NaN` values in metro division columns indicate the CBSA has no subdivisions.
- Regional and division classifications classifications use U.S. Census Bureau definitions: https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf
