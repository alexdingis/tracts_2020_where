  - 2022 census tract GEOID (this accounts for Connecticut's changed census tract GEOIDs)
  - 2020 decennial census total population
- Census Place (Using 2022 GeoCorr with population weight) including how the tract was related (whether all or part of the tract is part of the place)
-   Place name and title
- CBSA definitions
  - CBSA code and title
  - CSA code and title
  - Central or Outlying county
  - Metropolitan division and code (where available)

## üìå Notes

- Distance and percentile values are calculated using tract centroids and CBSA center points defined as the city hall of the central city in the CBSA.
- `NaN` values in metro division columns indicate the CBSA has no subdivisions.
- Regional and division classifications classifications use U.S. Census Bureau definitions: https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf
